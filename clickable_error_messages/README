Clickable Error Messages
======================

Have a long form, or at least one that scrolls past the main page. Want to give your users more interactivity on the forms?

This is unobtrusive, no extra markup is required. If you remove it, your application will work as normal.

NOTE: I am going to work on making this completely unobtrusive and so that it does not mess with .to_xml etc. This will require more 
      hacking at a later date though.


Example
=======

In your view:
	<%= error_messages_for :user %>
	
Example goes here.
		<div class="errorExplanation" id="errorExplanation">
			<h2>2 errors prohibited this user from being saved</h2>
			<p>There were problems with the following fields:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#user_password">Password</a> can't be blank</li>
				<li><a href="#user_email">Email</a> can't be blank</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
